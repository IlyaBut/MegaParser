"WRITING SESSION & WORKSHOP – May 2025 – Ilhabela Island, Brazil",12 Feb 2025,Brazil,"This will be a special session held at Casa Na Ilha besides the multidisciplinary sessions.Duration: 3 weeksAvailable Dates:MARCH AND MAY 2025 besides the multidisciplinary sessions.MARCH 2025: March 11 to April 1MAY 2025: May 10 to May 31Open to all individuals who have the passion of writing, in any form, from flash fiction, prose, poetry, songs lyrics, playwriting, journalism, hybrid, essays and want to deep dive into understanding each one’s process and/or shape a specific writing project they are starting, working on or ending, away from daily routines.Nevertheless, it is not a requirement to have an active project to work on.There are no academic requirements but each one’s own writing and the desire to devote this time to focus on writing, to grow and expand the practice nurturing within a community of pairs.No final product would be expected but the engagement in writing daily and sharing/discussing with the rest of the group.Artist from all nationalities are welcome to apply, the coordinator speaks fluent English, Spanish and Portuguese, though in the spirit of sharing with others in the workshop, spoken and written English as a common language to be able to share and communicate between each other though not a requirement, would be a plus for taking advantage of the workshop and the group experience.SESSION & WORKSHOP GENERALSThe goal for this session is to understand where as writers are we individually coming from & try to further work by offering ideas, craft tools and advice to be able to develop a practice and process that would fit each individual.There would be no imposing approach, subject, form, theme to writing on others, nor any aesthetic or ideological superiority of any forms of poetry or prose or approaches, any schools of art or methods of thinking about art.Together we will try to unravel and understand our process of writing, what we want to communicate, to tell and find the ways that better suit each one’s voice to express.The workshop will be non-hierarchical creative space in which everyone feels challenged & inspired, & everyone feels heard. As a group, we will work on perceiving or relating to others’ experiences, and we will encourage & welcome any public or private discourse regarding anything each one might do.There would be no right or wrong, good or bad writing.

Buinho FabLab residency program (Portugal) – 2025 Opencall,14 Feb 2025,Portugal,"Surrounded by breathtaking natural landscapes and rich heritage, Buinho combines a state-of-the-art fablab and studios fully equipped with the tools and equipment necessary to amplify the possibilities for experimentation among our residents. From laser cutting to 3D printing and other cutting-edge technologies, we provide access to these resources, along with free introductory courses and production assistance.The Buinho Residency program welcomes creatives and researchers from diverse backgrounds, fostering exchange, dialogue, and innovative exploration. The residencies are process-based, allowing visiting artists to develop projects in response to the relationship with the local environment and community or to conduct research benefiting from Buinho’s resources, and the daily life and environment of Messejana.Buinho Fablab opened in Alentejo (Southern region of Portugal) with invaluable support from a seasoned curatorial team boasting a decade of experience in organizing and supporting residency programs across Portugal.Since 2016, Buinho has been successfully growing the number of applications making it a sought-after artistic residency program. Today Buinho is a European reference as one of the only artistic residencies based on a Fablab, enabling the merging of Art, Technology, and Community engagement. Ever since we have received visual artists, performance artists, photographers, curators, writers, sculptors, designers, and media artists, from all the different continents, confirming the eclectic nature of our program.Today Buinho provides access to six different locations within the small town of Messejana, offering private accommodation, shared and individual studios, a digital fabrication workshop, recycling facilities, educational hubs, and exhibition spaces. Besides our own houses and equipment, we also run together with the local municipality a Precious Plastic Workshop, where resident artists can work with metal, larger sculpture pieces or installations, or recycle plastic. Together with the local school and kindergarten, we provide free educational activities to local children (3 to 12 years old), in our local makerspace, and to which residents can propose activities and workshops.The residency program besides providing production support, and access to the equipment and spaces, also includes free weekly tutorials and workshops about 3D printing, 3D modeling, laser cutting, robotics, and plastic recycling. The program also includes weekly contact with the locals from Messejana where we explore traditional practices or visit traditional artisans’ workshops. Buinho also offers some special programs and workshops to our residents, such as the Precious Plastic Workshop (for recycling plastic), or our special education branch called Buinho Educativo (a network of Educational Makerspaces that spread beyond Messejana to other regional towns).To know more about Messejana please access the two videos we prepared by clicking on the links:Messejana Village of Makers – https://vimeo.com/250777448Messejana Dança dos Pássaros – https://vimeo.com/443880245Duration of residencyThe minimum period of stay is 2 weeks, and the maximum is 2 months. We accept artists who apply just for two weeks since some may have work restrictions (for example professors), and we don´t want to create entry barriers to those with professional duties. Nevertheless, we encourage artists to apply to a superior period to improve the quality of the residency (research, production, experience). As a reference, we usually receive per year around 50 artists, with an average period of stay of 1 month and a half.AccommodationBuinho currently oversees six distinct houses, each designed with unique purposes and features in mind. Among these, three houses are exclusively designated for the Creative Residency program, providing a selection of single and double bedrooms, both shared and private studios, as well as communal living amenities. The remaining houses grant all residents access to well-equipped working laboratories, facilitating the advancement of their respective projects. Casa da Avo is located at the heart of Messejana, offering two spacious studios that overlook the main town square, along with two private bedrooms discreetly positioned at the rear of the house to ensure optimal privacy. In addition to its charming courtyard and terrace, the standout feature of this house is its compact yet well-appointed jewelry laboratory, complete with a cozy fireplace to keep you warm during the winter months. Sao Joao house is an XIX-century shepherd’s house, remodeled in 2019 to offer a unique charm. It is located in the street of the museum, on top of a hill, offering from its garden a unique view over Messejana. It’s studios with high white walls and quiet environment offer the perfect setting for visual artists and writers. Joaquina’s house was our latest achievement and finding. It is a completely rebuilt one-person apartment that offers a private studio and accommodation to a resident looking for more quietness and privacy. It is located just 300 meters from Messejana’s central square, in a very central and typical section of the historic center. The Buinho main hub and HQ embraces a modern, open-space design, featuring a central studio in the main building and a workshop located in the backyard. In 2015, this entire interior space underwent a comprehensive redesign and reconstruction, marking it as the inaugural house within this project and granting it the privilege of its distinctive name. Serving as Buinho’s primary headquarters, this house is home to the Fablab and Precious Plastic facilities. Buinho Educativo Messejana is an extension of Buinho’s main fablab, with a specific focus on our educational initiatives. Within its confines, you’ll find two spacious rooms, both equipped with a comprehensive array of digital fabrication tools, including laser cutters, 3D printers, and vinyl cutters. Additionally, it boasts an extensive collection of electronic components, robotics resources, VR headsets, and various other devices. Its distinctive capabilities make it accessible to both residents and educators, positioning it as the central hub for our workshops and training programs.   All houses are fully equipped and have access to a high-speed internet connection (Starlink). Besides the working studios, each bedroom also provides private desk space, adding more quality for individual project development. Free Wi-Fi access is available in all interior and exterior spaces. All houses have equipped kitchens that can be used freely by our residents to prepare their meals. Residents also have individual storage space and a fridge to keep their food. Residents are responsible for the safekeeping and good use of the household equipment and respect the shared space by keeping it clean and organized. Accommodation houses also include linen, towels, and kitchen appliances for the comfort of their residents. Once a week there will be a cleaning service, while residents are responsible for their laundry and the organization of common spaces. Overall, the facilities are furnished and offer comfortable working spaces. Depending on availability residents are welcome to have visiting guests or partners. However, artists are required to notify the period of stay, check the availability of spaces, and cover the corresponding additional costs to the residency. Please note that we also offer access to other studios and special workshop spaces. These spaces include: Buinho main studios and Fablab, which is equipped with tools and machines (workstations, laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC’s, vinyl cutters, among other equipments) to enhance the possibilities of experimentation of our residents. Buinho Precious Plastic, a community recycling center where artists can not only transform plastic waste but also use the machines for artistic research and experimentation. We are currently installing bioplastic machines to complement the existing ones. Buinho Educativo Messejana is a joint project and a volunteer project coordinated by Buinho that offers free activities for children and young people from Messejana, but also exhibition opportunities and more studios for the artists in residency.Disciplines, work equipment and assistanceDisciplines can vary a lot since in Buinho we privilege an eclectic selection of artists. Disciplines can include visual artists, media artists, video and sound, performance, sculpture, designers, makers, photographers, writers, and researchers, of all ages and nationalities. We provide both curatorial and production support to each artist, together with other events that compose the residency. The events include artists’ presentations/talks, encounters and engagement with the local community, development of workshops and tutorials in several disciplines, among other initiatives. Buinho offers a unique opportunity to work within a fablab, meaning that artists have access to different digital fabrication technology, such as laser cutters, 3D printers, vinyl cutters, CNC routers, among others.Studio / WorkspaceEach house has its own dedicated studio space. Buinho offers a mix of shared and private studio spaces according to the needs and requirements of each residency project. Our studios differ in nature and purpose (some are more dedicated to painting, drawing, and large-scale projects, as they offer easels, plenty of natural light, and big white walls) other spaces are dedicated to more design activities, offering access to IMacs, PC´s, 3D printers, electronics bench, among other equipment) and while others are more construction and building spaces, where artists can work with different technologies and materials, as plastic, wood, or metal, offering wide working spaces with access to specialized tools and prototyping machinery. Some studios are located within the houses of Buinho, others are in partnership with local entities. The Precious Plastic Workshop is located in the main fablab location and offers artists in residency, students, and local community members the possibility to work with Plastic Recycling enabling the transformation of plastic waste into new creations. We have the four machines of the Precious Plastic Machine, which are also at the disposal of our residents for experimental art projects, learning, and social sharing.

As such, we have to apply fees to cover the running costs of the residency and keep the investment in working spaces and accommodation. At Buinho, we strive to tailor the residency fees to align with the unique attributes of the accommodations we offer. For instance, “Joaquina’s” represents a self-contained studio house exclusively designated for one artist, whereas “São João” is a shared house, although with private accommodation. This differentiation in fees underscores our commitment to establishing a more equitable system among residents, facilitating access for those with limited financial resources to participate in the Buinho AiR program. Monthly fees for 2025 are the following: São João larger bedroom with private bathroom – 900€; São João other bedrooms – 800€; Joaquina’s studio house – 1000€; Casa da Avó – 900€ An accompanying person has a 50% discount but must share the accommodation. It is another measure to support couples, artists with children, or possible artistic collaborations. The minimum duration of each residency is two weeks and the maximum is two months. Residencies should start either on the 1st or on the 15th of each month.

All other cancellations will not result in a refund. Deposits are non-refundable and residency dates are non-transferable.Expectations towards the artistWe actively promote participants to explore the full spectrum of creative potential, leveraging our exceptional resources and extensive support. Moreover, we are committed to fostering deeper connections with the local community by inviting residency artists to create workshops and exchange experiences with community members.

"Drawing Canyon, Sage and Sky – New Mexico Artist Retreat",15 Feb 2025,United States,"This is an immersive drawing retreat for artists keen to experiment with mark and image, create with natural materials, and connect to the experience of drawing within the stunning landscape of Northern New Mexico. The retreat creates the mental space to sit, sense, and create with river, stones, and sky, find good ground, and come away with a body of original artwork directly inspired by place.The residential retreat takes up drawing in an expanded, embodied sense – some may be compelled by the shape and color of the cliffs, while others draw the sound of wind, flow of the river, or simply feel what it’s like to collect and grind clay into powder pigment to draw the red line of the mesa.Lodging is at the warm and wonderful Cañon del Rio Inn and Spa outside the village of Jemez Springs. All rooms are single-occupancy. The retreat is designed for six participants, and we have the entire property to ourselves. Walking trails go right out the back door and along the Jemez River.We go together into the field in the mornings for inspiration, walking the red rock canyons, ancient volcanic caldera, the nearby ruins. In the afternoons, I do natural material demos and tutorials and we have one-on-one talks about any aspect of drawing you want to explore. It’s a time to work independently, wander the trails, read, and restore. There is an open buffet of art supplies and many ways to put them in action, plus a library of books on everything from geology to color theory to regional history. Group conversations come as way to pause and reflect at the end of the day, as we enjoy a healthy, delicious chef-prepared dinner under the stars.Application is required.

"Call for Summer Retreat 2025 – ARiR Guiniguada, Gran Canaria",15 Feb 2025,Spain,"Exceptional artist / researcher resident / guest community, or solitude if you please, in a bold vast space that invites for musing, far away from heavy civilization and buzzing crowds, and still within easy reach, in an unconquerable castle, a landscape straight out of a fairy-tale, in one of the world’s best climates by common consensus. Note this is the fertile northern part of the island, thus through the winter months do not expect a continental summer, but rather springlike weather; also, throughout the summer months we are not having as much heat as the continent does – the ocean temperates.We are not about consumer comfort; those who like to stay with us prefer to get one step closer to nature – both their own physique and the outside, non-artificial environment – and are not wary of adventure. Yes, this is a rural setting, neighbours live here, cut the branches, the dogs do bark, also there are goats and roosters, even an owl you can hear at times!In order to be able to slow down life, we believe it is worth breaking our routines from time to time – this is why artist-in-residencies have spread as a way of enhancing creativity through (re)settling our minds. Our idea was that the notion of the AIR could be expanded by not having artists exclusively at the specific location, but enabling them to mix with academic researchers. We believe heterogeneity always helps, thus, the more people could broaden their comprehensions of their worlds, the better for humankind!This is why we start our venture in this house, not for too many persons, and not for too few. Our goal is to host, in this hybridised form of staying, people who are ready to leave the routines of their home behind and spend time in our company thinking, working, relaxing, discussing in our house.Note throughout the summer months we are not having as much heat as the continent does – the ocean temperates.Duration of residencyMinimum stay 2 weeks, maximum 4 weeks (whole period).AccommodationThe house is an ‘organic’ type – this means by local standards it had been used first as a series of caves, since unkown times, and the previous owners enlarged it step by step in the directions where the rocky hillside has permitted.

La Macina di San Cresci – Tuscany Italy:  An inspiring rural retreat and residency,15 Feb 2025,Italy,"Live and work in the shadow of the oldest church in all of Chianti, Pieve di San Cresci.

La Macina di San Cresci overlooks the classic Tuscan town of Greve in Chianti and is located just a short drive from Florence and Siena.La Macina di San Cresci is a unique place where artists can live and work together. A historic monument of greenery and stone, it is surrounded by gorgeous hillsides of vineyards and olive groves.

La Macina operates year round and accepts residency applications on a rolling basis (there are no application fees and no deadlines!).At La Macina, artists can find whatever sort of process they need; we have a close-knit community made up of visiting artists and local friends, but there is also plenty of peace and quiet for those who seek relaxation and escape.

"2nd Call for “Spring 2” Retreat 2025 – ARiR Guiniguada, Gran Canaria",16 Feb 2025,Spain,"Exceptional artist / researcher resident / guest community, or solitude if you please, in a bold vast space that invites for musing, far away from heavy civilization and buzzing crowds, and still within easy reach, in an unconquerable castle, a landscape straight out of a fairy-tale, in one of the world’s best climates by common consensus. Note this is the fertile northern part of the island, thus through the winter months do not expect a continental summer, but rather springlike weather; also, throughout the summer months we are not having as much heat as the continent does – the ocean temperates.We are not about consumer comfort; those who like to stay with us prefer to get one step closer to nature – both their own physique and the outside, non-artificial environment – and are not wary of adventure. Yes, this is a rural setting, neighbours live here, cut the branches, the dogs do bark, also there are goats and roosters, even an owl you can hear at times!In order to be able to slow down life, we believe it is worth breaking our routines from time to time – this is why artist-in-residencies have spread as a way of enhancing creativity through (re)settling our minds. Our idea was that the notion of the AIR could be expanded by not having artists exclusively at the specific location, but enabling them to mix with academic researchers. We believe heterogeneity always helps, thus, the more people could broaden their comprehensions of their worlds, the better for humankind!This is why we start our venture in this house, not for too many persons, and not for too few. Our goal is to host, in this hybridised form of staying, people who are ready to leave the routines of their home behind and spend time in our company thinking, working, relaxing, discussing in our house.Duration of residencyMinimum stay 2 weeks, maximum 4 weeks (whole period).AccommodationThe house is an ‘organic’ type – this means by local standards it had been used first as a series of caves, since unkown times, and the previous owners enlarged it step by step in the directions where the rocky hillside has permitted. The residency area starts above our apartment; consisting of five rooms. Each room is separate, they do not open from each other. A shared kitchen and various terraces are at your disposal, and there are two shared bathrooms.Disciplines, work equipment and assistanceArtist and Researcher in Residence Guiniguada is awaiting guests who have projects or would want to get a deeper understanding of the following issues: Ecology & society: ecological art, food chain, carbon and nitrogen cycle, recuperation of ecosystems. Arts & society: visual language, contemporary art of light, hermetic traditions in modern art. Human rights & society: equality of opportunity, equal treatment, social exclusion/inclusion. General facilities / services: large outdoor and indoor spaces, large work desks, large work walls, library, abundance of organic material, basic wood and metal working electric tools, basic manual stone working tools, manual gardening, landscaping tools, collection of international and Canarian fresh herbs for cooking and tea, internet (The Canarians take a different pace in the project of eradicating the material world, but we strive to provide broadband wifi in the house. 4G signal at every point.), parking is possible on site, excursion recommendations, organised trips (additional charge), home restaurant from minimum 3 persons (additional charge, ordered in advance, on site).Studio / WorkspaceThe rooms serve as separate ateliers, for open air work the many terraces and for interior work our entrance building can be used, besides the natural surroundings.
